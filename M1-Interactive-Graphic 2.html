		<div>There are many ways to visually represent data. Common forms of data visualization are bar graphs, line graphs, scatter plots, and pie charts. Choosing the most effective form depends on the type of data values you aim to present, the insights you want the audience to gain, and the story that you aim to tell through the data. 

Begin by asking yourself what you want to represent in the visualization. For example, do you want to show a comparison, relationship, hierarchy, distribution, concept, pattern, or composition between two or more sets of data? Importantly, effective data forms account for the audience’s biases, context, and data usage. Thus, when choosing a form, consider whether it will be understood by the target audience.

		<div>Option 2</div>
		<div>Message
</div>
		<div>Option 1</div>
		<div>Your data visualization should have a clear message. The data points that are more important than others should be emphasized to clearly indicate the key insights of the data. Use content hierarchy, such as clear headings and subheadings, as well as design tools such as color, size, layout, and iconography, to visually highlight key points.

		<div>Option 4</div>
		<div>Option 1</div>
		<div>Option  1</div>
		<div>Option 3</div>
		<div>Do choose a visual hierarchy to emphasize key data insights</div>
		<div>Do not present all data insights equally, without using a visual hierarchy to emphasize key data insights.</div>
		<div>Clutter
</div>
		<div>Effective data visualizations only contain necessary information designed in the most legible way. When graphic elements and effects such as lines, labels, borders, and color are overused, they can distract your audience and make the key message illegible or unclear.
</div>
		<div>Option 4</div>
		<div>Hotspot text sample on image 4</div>
		<div>Do use graphic elements sparingly to avoid clutter and support the key message being communicated.
</div>
		<div>Do simplify the message by eliminating unnecessary and repititive content.</div>
		<div>Do not duplicate content in order to create emphasis.</div>
		<div>Do not use colour, size, layout, and iconography decoratively.</div>
